EMG Decompostion (assignment 2)
This assignment was made with the bonus part (hkmeans function)

Important note

1) After making moving average step on the signal, I noticed that the signal is shifted a little bit to the right which made it hard to draw the peaks on the raw data so I tried to delay the orginal signal to draw it and it worked


2) The MUAPS from question one is the result of the smoothed data not the raw data as it should be however; I believe that it won`t make a big difference but you can notice in the detected MUAP that its not centered around 10 as it should be due to shifting that happened from smoothing the signal
